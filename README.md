# YSU
*Stream updates to React components from ES6 generators*

## Introduction

YSU is an experimental library to manage asynchronous state in React.

It stands for yield sequential updates, which describes the process of **streaming updates to components from generators.**

## Basic Example

```js
import { update, sequence } from "ysu";

// sequence --
async function* randomQuoteSequence() {
  yield update("LOADING");

  try {
    const res = await fetch("https://programming-quotes-api.herokuapp.com/quotes/random");
    const data = await res.json();

    yield update("READY", data);
  } catch (error) {
    yield update("FAILED", error);
  }
}

// component --
const RandomQuote = props => {
  const [quote, getQuote] = props.randomQuote;

  useEffect(() => {
    getQuote();
  }, [getQuote]);

  return (
    <>
      {quote.status === "LOADING" && <p>Loading...</p>}
      {quote.status === "READY" && <p>{quote.payload.en}</p>}
      {quote.status === "FAILED" && <p>{quote.payload.message}</p>}
      <button onClick={getQuote}>Get another quote</button>
    </>
  );
};

export default sequence({
  randomQuote: randomQuoteSequence
})(RandomQuote);
```

The component is connected to the generator using the `sequence` higher-order component. When(ever) the generator yields an `update` the component (re)renders.

Each field passed to `sequence` is mapped to a prop which contains a pair. In this example the prop `randomQuote` holds the pair:

- `[quote, ` reflects the current status of the sequence, along with any data associated with that status.
- `getQuote]` a function that when called initiates the sequence.

The `randomQuote` sequence starts when the component mounts, or when the user clicks the *Get another quote* button. This is a fairly straightforward example, however other examples with live demos are linked below.

## Examples

- [Remote Data Fetching](https://github.com/callum-hart/ysu/tree/master/src/examples/RemoteData) Similar to the basic example above.
- [Polling](https://github.com/callum-hart/ysu/tree/master/src/examples/Polling) Endpoint is polled every N seconds, where the user can change the frequency of, or pause and resume polling.
- [Retry Request](https://github.com/callum-hart/ysu/tree/master/src/examples/RetryRequest) Retries an XHR request until a certain condition is met, or number of retries exceeds 5 attempts.
- [Aggregation](https://github.com/callum-hart/ysu/tree/master/src/examples/Aggregation) Render data from multiple endpoints only when all datasets are ready.
- [Race](https://github.com/callum-hart/ysu/tree/master/src/examples/Race) Time constraign a request to 2 seconds so that the UI isn't blocked on slow internet connections.
- [User Journey](https://github.com/callum-hart/ysu/tree/master/src/examples/UserJourney) Form in which the user has 5 seconds to either confirm or cancel submission.
- [Undo](https://github.com/callum-hart/ysu/tree/master/src/examples/Undo) After submitting a form the user can change their mind by clicking undo.
- [Debounce](https://github.com/callum-hart/ysu/tree/master/src/examples/Debounce) Run a remote search query once the user has stopped typing for 1 second.
- [Composition](https://github.com/callum-hart/ysu/tree/master/src/examples/Composition) Compose a sequence from multiple generators.

The examples can be viewed locally by cloning the repository and running `npm install` and then `npm start`.

## Overview

Much of what makes UI programming difficult is managing values that change over time. If we take the sterotypical async example of making an API request, the UI reflects a sequence of state changes.

The state starts off **idle** → then goes to \***loading** → then finishes with \*\***success** or **failed**.

<sup>*usually triggered on component mount / user interaction. **depending on the API response.</sup>

Our API request has three sequential stages with four possible statuses.

Async generators (`async function*`) are very good at coordinating sequences since they can be paused, exited and resumed.

This means we can do something asynchronous → yield an update to the UI → re-enter to resume where we left off → do something else → yield another update to the UI → and so forth.

The API request can be represented using a sequence diagram:

| Time  | Component                 | Generator |
| ----- | ------------------------- | --------- |
| ↓     | initiate sequence ------> |           |
| ↓     |                      | <------ yield "loading" |
| ↓     | loading...           | call API |
| ↓     | ✅success            | <------ yield "success" on resolve |
| ↓     | ❌error              | <------ yield "failed" on reject |

You may have noticed this sequence diagram depicts exactly what is happening in the basic example shown earlier.

Since yielding from a generator triggers a (re)render in the UI – and generators can generate values forever – implementing infinite and finite sequences such as polling or retries is trivial.

Polling is as simple as calling an endpoint and yielding an update to the UI from within an [infinite loop](https://github.com/callum-hart/ysu/blob/master/src/examples/Polling/sequence.js#L8). Whilst retrying an XHR request does the same but within a [finite loop](https://github.com/callum-hart/ysu/blob/master/src/examples/RetryRequest/sequence.js#L18).

Note: on component unmount any running sequences are stopped and scheduled updates cancelled automatically. This ensures that infinite sequences (such as polling) only run when the component is mounted.

## Goals / Design Decisions

- Keep asynchronous state out of components
- Don't block rendering ([always be ready to render](https://overreacted.io/writing-resilient-components/#principle-2-always-be-ready-to-render))
- Component state over global state
- Same API for function and class components
- Predictable rendering (1 yield equals 1 render)
- Simple mental model (components just recieve props)
- Use [status enums](https://kentcdodds.com/blog/stop-using-isloading-booleans)
- Decorator approach popularised by Redux
- Pair approach popularised by hooks

## API

YSU exports the following functions:

```js
import { sequence, update, pause } from "ysu";
```

### `sequence`

Higher-order component that connects a component to one or more generators:

```js
sequence(generatorMap, middleware?)(Component);
```
#### `generatorMap`

Object that maps generator functions to component props:

```js
sequence(
  {
    foo: fooSequence,
    bar: barSequence
  }
)(Component);
```

In this example `fooSequence` will be available in the component via the prop `foo`. Each prop (such as foo and bar) is an array containing 3 items:

```js
const [value, initiator, goodies] = props.foo;
```

0. `value` Object containing:
    - `status` String: the status of the sequence (i.e: `"LOADING"`)
    - `payload?` Any: data associated with the current status (i.e: `{ userName: "@chart" }`)
1. `initiator` Function: that starts the sequence
2. `goodies` Object containing:
    - `history` Component: that renders the history of the sequence (used during development like devtools). Note: the history is transient and destroyed when the component unmounts.
    - `suspend` Function: that stops the sequence and cancels any scheduled updates (i.e: click button to stop polling)

#### `middleware`

One or more functions that are subscribed to the sequence. They are called whenever a generator yields an update:

```js
sequence(
  {
    foo: fooSequence,
    bar: barSequence
  },
  trackingMiddleware,
  errorMiddleware,
  // as many middlewares you desire
)(Component);

function trackingMiddleware({ status, payload, meta }) {
  if (status === "SUCCESS") {
    // track conversion
  }
}

function errorMiddleware({ status, payload, meta }) {
  if (status === "FAILED") {
    // log error
  }
}
```

Each middleware function is passed an object containing:

- `status` String: the status of the sequence
- `payload?` Any: data associated with the current status
- `meta` Object containing:
  - `sequenceId` String: corresponds to the name of the prop (i.e: `foo` or `bar`)

Note: middleware is colocated with components since sequences could have different tracking or error logging requirements depending on where they’re used.

### `update`

Pure function that describes a step in a sequence:

```js
yield update(status, payload?);
```

- `status` String: the status of the sequence
- `payload?` Any: data associated with the current status

Returns an object containing `{ status, payload? }`.

### `pause`

Helper function that pauses a sequence for a given amount of time:

```js
await pause(delay);
```

- `delay` Number: how long in milliseconds the sequence should be paused

Returns a Promise.

## Todos / Ideas

Tests.

Only include history and logger in development bundles.

Add spinner/loading bar to history to indicate when sequence is running. **Status:** logic DONE, UI (pulsating blue circle next to sequence name) TODO

Show errors in history (i.e anything that passes through `logError`). **Status:** logic DONE, UI (red circle next to sequence name, on click scroll to bottom) TODO

Visual cue in history when sequence has been programmatically suspended. **Status:** logic DONE, UI (grey circle next to sequence name, on click scroll to bottom, add timestamp to suspended history item) TODO

Ability to suspend/restart sequence from history. **Status:** logic DONE (didn't find restart very useful), UI (if any) TODO

Use same colours in logger as used in history.

Expose back/forward functions for UIs with undo/redo:

```js
const [quote, getQuote, { goBack, goForward }] = props.quoteSequence;
```

Persist context between yields. This would be useful when composing multiple sequences:

```js
// sequence --
yield update("READY", { rates }, { persist: true });
// ...yields from other generators...

// component --
const [{ status, payload }, transition, { context }] = props.currencyConverter;

<>{context.rates}</> // rates available in context for any statuses that follow READY
```

Automatically suspend a running sequence when new sequence is initiated.

Investigate how YSU would integrate with React suspense and concurrent mode.

Only publish library code to npm.

In-built cache and sequence deduplication.

Hooks alternative to higher-order component API:

```js
const [quote, getQuote, goodies] = useYsu(randomQuoteSequence);

// with unique key for in-built cache: `useYsu('key', randomQuoteSequence)`
```
